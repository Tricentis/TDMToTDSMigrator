# TDMToTDSMigrator

 Transfer test data from TDM to TDS

 TDM data is contained in an exported .tdd file in user file system
 
 tdd file is picked from filesystem, decompressed into XML, then converted into TdmDataDocument class
 
 Data records are parsed and put into a dictionary of categories

 The user can create and manipulate repositories as well as filter out categories

 A log textbox accompanies the user during the process.
