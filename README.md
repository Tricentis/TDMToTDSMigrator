# TDMToTDSMigrator

# Transfer client test data from TDM to TDS

# User must enter a valid TDS url and confirm it
# TDM data is contained in an exported .tdd file in the user's file system
# tdd file is decompressed into XML, then parsed into a list of objects (TableObject)
# The list of TableObject is then read, converted into Json objects and fed to the API

# The user can create and manipulate repositories as well as filter TDM data categories (Person, City...)

# A log box accompanies the user in the process of transferring his data
